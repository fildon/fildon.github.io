      <h2>About this page</h2>
      <p>
        This is a webpage to display some of my side projects. It is simple by
        design, developed to support any device or browser, in accordance with
        the graceful degradation and progressive enhancement philosophies. It
        conforms to ARIA best practices such as semantic HTML and support for
        screen readers.

      <a href="./boids"><h3>üê¶ Boids</h3></a>
      <p>
        An implementation of an artificial life program, first developed in the
        1980s. In brief, just three simple rules lead to intelligent flocking
        behaviour. Implemented all my own tooling from the groundup, including
        vector algebra and dynamic frame loop adjustments. I am currently
        working on adding neural-net powered hunters to the simulation.

      <a href="./ceramic"><h3>ü•£ Ceramic</h3></a>
      <p>
        A reusable React component library. Complete with 100% test coverage,
        extensive documentation and publically available Storybook. Living
        documentation is generated dynamically by JSDocs coming directly from
        the source code itself.

      <a href="./lindenmayer"><h3>üå≥ Lindenmayer</h3></a>
      <p>
        A Lindenmayer fractal generator. Creates a random branch structure and
        recursively reapplies it to itself. Written solely in Vanilla JS and
        HTML5 Canvas. Dynamically computes ideal depth generation based on
        browser performance.

      <a href="./voronoi"><h3>üêù Voronoi</h3></a>
      <p>
        A little experiment with voronoi cells. A cloud of points travel
        randomly across the world space, while every frame the space is divided
        by Voronoi cells. Most of the heavy lifting is done by
        <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-delaunay">d3-delaunay</a>

      <a href="./convection"><h3>‚òï Convection</h3></a>
      <p>
        A one-day hack to build a physics simulation, which aims to demonstrate
        that temperature mixing is an emergent property of thermal expansion.
        Got the idea for this while watching a pot of water boil.

      <a href="./webgltest"><h3>üé≤ WebGLTest</h3></a>
      <p>
        A little test of three.js, which itself uses WebGL. Renders a rotating
        cube and some point lights in real time. A great example of how
        JavaScript can be used to leverage graphics hardware.

      <a href="./phong"><h3>üí° Phong</h3></a>
      <p>
        Hand made raytracer using only Typescript. A fun experiment in the
        mathematics of perspective geometry. Performance is very much
        bottlenecked by the browser.
